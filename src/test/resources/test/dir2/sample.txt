ssue: The current conventional Cucumber report is cumbersome and time-consuming, requiring up to 4 hours for testers to thoroughly investigate before sharing results with stakeholders. This prolonged investigation time delays the communication process and affects overall productivity. Additionally, the report's presentation of known failures in a complete red format is intimidating and alarming to customers, creating unnecessary concerns and potentially damaging stakeholder confidence in the testing process.

Objective: The primary objective is to develop a more elegant and easily interpretable report that can streamline the communication of automation test results to stakeholders. This new report should effectively differentiate between new failures and known failures, making it more pleasant and less alarming for stakeholders. By optimizing the report generation and interpretation process, the aim is to reduce the interpretation time from the current 4 hours to approximately 1 to 1.5 hours per regression testing session.

Solution: The solution involves customizing the existing Cucumber report generator to create a new JSON and HTML report, named "Easy Cucumber Report." This report will provide a clearer view of current release information, integrating pie charts for execution statistics and an overall test case summary. It will also include complete evidence for each testable requirement with proper color coding to enhance readability. The customization will ensure that known failures are not represented in an alarming red color, thereby creating a more stakeholder-friendly report.

Benefits: The Easy Cucumber Report will significantly reduce the time required for testers to investigate and interpret results, bringing the time down to about 1 to 1.5 hours. This streamlined process will facilitate quicker and more efficient communication with stakeholders. The new report will present a clearer and more pleasant view of test results, effectively differentiating between new and known failures. Visual aids such as pie charts will provide quick insights into execution statistics, while comprehensive evidence for each testable requirement will support detailed analysis. Overall, this will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the reporting process, leading to improved stakeholder confidence and satisfaction.




Issue: The Selenium automation framework previously uploaded a new document to Azure Cloud storage for each test case, leading to the saturation of the document blob storage. This approach not only consumed excessive storage space but also negatively impacted the efficiency and performance of the automation framework, resulting in longer regression run times.

Objective: The goal is to optimize the use of Azure Cloud storage by reducing unnecessary document uploads. This involves improving the efficiency and performance of the automation framework, thereby reducing the overall regression timing and enhancing the project's operational effectiveness.

Solution: To address the issue, a new method was developed to create a document ID once and reuse it across all test cases as needed. This solution eliminates the need for repeated document uploads, significantly reducing the storage consumption on Azure Cloud. By reusing the document ID, the framework avoids the redundancy of uploading the same document multiple times, streamlining the entire process.

Benefits: This solution drastically reduces storage usage on Azure Cloud, preventing the saturation of document blob storage. Consequently, it improves the overall efficiency and performance of the automation framework, reducing the regression run time by approximately 20 minutes. This enhancement not only optimizes resource utilization but also accelerates the testing cycle, leading to quicker feedback and more efficient project management.
